Welsh devolution referendum 2011 This collection of websites focuses on the referendum on the powers of the National Assembly for Wales, held on March 3rd 2011. The voters of Wales had approved a very limited form of devolution in September 1997 by a wafer thin majority of 6,721 votes. Following the coalition agreement between Labour and Plaid Cymru, signed after the 2007 Assembly election, a further referendum was held in 2011 on granting the Assembly the power to make laws without having to first seek permission from the UK Parliament. The Yes for Wales campaign was backed by Assembly Members from all 4 main parties, trade unions and many parts of civic society while the True Wales campaign, which urged voters to say No described itself as a grass-roots organisation. On this occasion the result was far more decisive, with 517,132 voting yes, and 297,380 voting no. The only county to record a no majority was Monmouthshire, by 320 votes. Refferendwm datganoli Cymru 2011 Mae'r casgliad hwn o wefannau yn canolbwyntio ar y refferendwm ar bwerau i'r Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru, a gynhaliwyd ar Fawrth 3ydd 2011. Roedd pleidleiswyr Cymru wedi cymeradwyo ffurf cyfyngedig iawn o ddatganoli ym mis Medi 1997 gyda mwyafrif isel o 6,721 o bleidleisiau. Yn dilyn y cytundeb clymblaid rhwng Llafur a Phlaid Cymru, wedi'i lofnodi ar ôl etholiadau'r Cynulliad yn 2007, cynhaliwyd refferendwm pellach yn 2011 ar ganiatáu i'r Cynulliad y p&#373;er i wneud cyfreithiau heb orfod yn gyntaf i ofyn am ganiatâd gan Senedd y DU. Cefnogwyd yr ymgyrch Ie dros Gymru gan Aelodau Cynulliad or 4 prif blaid, undebau llafur a nifer o rannau o gymdeithas ddinesig tra bod yr ymgyrch Gwir Cymru, a oedd yn annog pleidleiswyr i ddweud "Na" yn disgrifio ei hun fel sefydliad ar lawr gwlad. Y tro hwn roedd y canlyniad yn llawer mwy pendant, gyda 517,132 o blaid, a 297,380 yn erbyn. Sir Fynwy oedd yr unig sir i bleidleisio mwyafrif o blaid na, o 320 o bleidleisiau.

National Assembly for Wales election 2011 This collection of websites focuses on the election for the National Assembly for Wales in 2011.

Sefydlwyd y Cynulliad yn 1999, ond y Pedwerydd Cynulliad, fyddair cyntaf i gael pwerau deddfu llawn mewn meysydd sydd wedi'u datganoli. Canlyniad yr etholiad oedd enillion ar gyfer y Blaid Lafur ar Ceidwadwyr a cholledion ar gyfer Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol Cymru a Phlaid Cymru, ond heb unrhyw blaid gyda mwyafrif. Yn dilyn yr etholiad, etholwyd Carwyn Jones AC, arweinydd y gr&#373;p Llafur, yn Brif Weinidog a ffurfiodd lywodraeth.
